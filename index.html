					In my initial analysis of the Boston real estate market, I am observing an
					upward trend in property prices over the past two decades (both in nominal and
					real terms). After adjusting for inflation using the Bureau of Labor Statistics'
					formula to convert nominal to real prices, I can see the increase more accurately.
					The blue bar, which represents nominal median prices, demonstrates a rapid growth
					in property values. This rise is indicative of a strong and growing real estate
					market in Boston. This sets the stage for a deeper exploration into the factors
					driving this and the broader implications on the housing dynamics.

					In the dataset, I noticed that certain ZIP codes appear only sporadically
					or are missing data for a majority of the years. For my analysis, ZIP codes
					such as 02134, 02126, 02136, and 02130 which exhibit significant gaps in
					the data, are excluded. This is done to ensure that my insights are based
					on continuous data, providing a more accurate reflection
					of long-term trends and patterns in the Boston real estate market.

					The bar chart shows the distribution of transactions across different
					property types, highlighting the focus of my analysis on residential
					buildings marked in blue as opposed to non-residential buildings such
					as banks or gas stations. These make up the majority of the transactions
					and will enable us to delve into the dynamics of the housing market.

				<figcaption>
					After conducting the initial filtering above, I am now ready to focus on my first outlined
					question. In recent years, Boston has seen an increase in the development of high-rise
					buildings. A notable trend I want to focus my analysis on is whether there is a 
					growing percentage of these properties that are owned by corporations. Corporate 
					ownership in residential areas can impact property availability 
					and housing prices. The upward slope of the red line in the graph highlights a 
					trend: an increasing proportion of high-rises are falling under corporate 
					ownership. This would signal to me that corporations view high rises as 
					profitable assets and I should investigate this trend further. 
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="CH2.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					To understand the trend of corporate ownership more, it is essential to investigate
					where these high-rises are located within Boston. By mapping the distribution and
					comparing the first and last five years in the dataset, I can gain insight into the
					'hot spots' of development. The pie charts represent the
					proportion of corporate-owned high-rises (indicated in red) and are sized according
					to the total number of high-rises within each zip code.

					<p>
					The visual comparison between the earlier and later periods reveals a notable
					increase in corporate ownership across several key areas of the city. Not only does
					this indicate a concentration of corporate interest in certain neighborhoods, but it
					also suggests a potential shift in the demographics and socio-economic status in
					these areas. I can also see that the pie charts in specific zip codes are larger, 
					suggesting an increase in high-rise development.
					</p>
				</figcaption>

			<figure>
				<img src="CH3.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					Understanding the financial implications of increased corporate ownership of high-rises,
					I next examine the change in real median prices within the zip codes. By focusing on areas
					with data available from both the initial and latter five-year periods, I can assess
					whether the presence of corporate-owned high-rises correlates with changes in property
					values. The bar chart above shows the percent change in the median real price of
					high-rises across different zip codes, indicating substantial price increases in
					these areas. This suggests that corporate
					investment in high-rises may be a contributing factor to rising property values, thus
					potentially affecting affordability for average Bostonians.

					Now let’s shift the focus to the second question. As Boston's market
					evolves, it is important to understand who is buying property. My analysis
					categorizes transactions as either investor or non-investor purchases across
					various property types over time. My goal is to look into patterns in investment
					activity and to investigate market dynamics.

					<p>
					The stacked bar chart illustrates the percentage of real estate transactions
					attributed to non-investors versus investors of various sizes. A distinct
					trend emerges: the share of properties purchased by non-investors has been
					decreasing over time across all property types. The increasing investor
					interest in multi-unit residences may also suggest a shift toward rental
					markets or property development projects.
					</p>			
				</figcaption>

			<figure>

				<figcaption>
					Next, I want to zoom in on the geographic distribution of investor transactions
					to examine the changing landscape. The maps juxtapose the investor activity for
					the periods 2003-2007 and 2018-2022, with the dots being sized by median real
					price. This offers a visual representation of where investors are directing
					their capital and reveals the changes in property valuations across Boston.
					The maps suggest that strategic investments have likely influenced the increase
					in real estate prices in specific neighborhoods. The higher median prices
					showed by the growing size of the circles reflect the effect of investor
					activities in evolving urban areas.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="CH6.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					Building on the understanding of investor influence, I want to now
					turn my attention to the luxury segment of the market (the threshold of
					$1 million for a luxury listing is an academically recognized benchmark
					in major U.S. urban markets, as suggested by studies published in the
					Journal of Real Estate Finance and Economics). Luxury listings not only
					reflect on the city's growth but also the shifts in high-end market
					demand. By exploring the change in the median prices of luxury listings,
					I can pinpoint the trends in investor engagement. The rising yellow bar
					(i.e. the percent share of luxury transactions) reveals that luxury
					transactions are claiming an increasing share of the market over the
					years, with the median real price of these luxury properties also climbing.
					As the upscale market expands, I am curious about the broader
					implications on housing affordability. 
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="CH7.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					Building upon the previous chart, I would now like to focus on the median
					real prices of luxury properties by property type.
					This will allow me to understand which categories are most seeked by
					upscale buyers. The median real price for apartments, 1-family, and 2-family
					residences exhibit volatility over time. This may indicate changing economic
					conditions or consumer preferences. The 3-family residences show a generally
					upward trend, but with less volatility. This would imply that these properties
					are less sensitive to market fluctuations. Lastly,
					condominiums display a different trend, with their median real prices
					increasing more consistently over time. This growth could indicate
					the increasing desirability of condominiums. These
					differences among property types highlight the varied preferences of
					luxury homebuyers.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="CH8.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					Translating this onto a map, I am now investigating the percent difference in
					median real prices for luxury listings over a ten year span (2012 vs 2022).
					The map helps me understand the specific areas that have become increasingly
					sought after. The red areas indicate zip codes experiencing a surge in median real
					prices, possibly driven by rising demand and urban development. In
					contrast, green shaded areas highlight locations where luxury property values
					have declined. I can see above that most of the zip codes are shaded
					in red, suggesting that a significant portion of Boston's neighborhoods
					have experienced a growth in luxury property values. Such an increase in
					luxury property prices raises questions about housing afforability as
					neighborhoods shift toward more upscale living.

				<figcaption>
					Lastly, I will dive deeper into the third question I outlined above. In assessing
					the impact of property flipping on Boston's housing market, I examine several data
					points to understand the trends, profitability, and geographic concentration of flipping
					activities. I begin my analysis by comparing median real prices of flipped versus
					non-flipped properties over time. I am hoping to understand whether properties
					that have been flipped result in higher prices. The convergence observed in the
					graph suggests that the flipping market has experienced fluctuations, with flipped
					properties sometimes underperforming non-flipped ones. This may reflect market
					dynamics such as pricing strategies or buyer behavior changes.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="CH10.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					Next, I would like to dive deeper into the flipping process by examining
					the duration of ownership before a flip occurs. This can reveal the preferred
					flip horizon and its influence on the market presence of flipped properties.
					The data shows an increasing preference towards long/medium-term flips.
					This could indicate that investors are favoring more significant renovations
					or developments, which require more extended periods and likely result
					in higher profits for the investor. The shift away from
					short-term flips could also be a response to the market situation, regulatory
					changes, or investors taking a more cautious investment approach.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="CH11.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					Furthermore, I analyze the financial outcomes of flipping by property
					type. My goal is to understand which types yield higher returns and how
					these returns vary. From the chart, I can observe that single-family
					residences have a large spread of returns, which suggests that there
					are instances of significant losses and substantial gains. The 2-family
					and 3-family residences, while also showing variability, do not have
					the extremes seen with single-family homes, suggesting a more moderate
					level of risk and return. Lastly, looking at condominiums, I can imply
					that flipping these properties tends to result in lower gains but more
					consistent and predictable outcomes.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="CH12.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					Lastly, I examine this from a geographic perspective to understand
					flipping concentration. Mapping flips by ZIP code provides insights
					into where flipping is most prevalent and its potential influence on
					neighborhoods. The heat map illustrates that specific ZIP codes experience
					higher flipping percentages. The areas marked by higher flipping percentages
					on the heat map correspond with those that have witnessed a notable increase
					in property values.

			<h2>Summary</h2>

			<p>High-rise development, investor activity, and property flipping are influencing
				the urban housing market. Corporations have increasingly taken ownership
				of high-rise buildings (with a siginificant increase in certain ZIP codes),
				suggesting a shift towards assets that promise substantial
				returns. This shift in property ownership could impact
				the socioeconomic makeup of communities and raise critical questions
				about housing affordability. Investment patterns have similarly changed over time,
				revealing a decline in properties acquired by non-investors. The luxury
				real estate segment has shown a remarkable increase in both the share of
				transactions and median real prices, reflecting a shift toward
				wealthier demographic. The practice of property flipping has seen a trend
				toward long/medium-term investments. Looking forward, these trends highlight
				the necessity for urban
				planning and policy-making that ensures that growth and development in
				Boston remain sustainable and equitable for all.
