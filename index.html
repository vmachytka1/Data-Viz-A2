			<h2>Discoveries & Insights</h2>

					In recent years, Boston has seen an increase in the development of high-rise
					buildings.A notable trend I want to focus my analysis on is whether there is a 
					growing percentage of these properties that are owned by corporations. Corporate 
					ownership in residential areas can impact local communities, property availability, 
					and housing prices. The upward slope of the red line in the graph highlights a 
					trend: an increasing proportion of high-rises are falling under corporate 
					ownership. This would signal to me that corporations view high rises as 
					profitable assets.

					To understand the trend of corporate ownership more, it is essential to investigate
					where these high-rises are located within Boston. By mapping the distribution and
					comparing the first and last five years in the dataset, we gain insight into the
					'hot spots' of development and corporate investment. The pie charts represent the
					proportion of corporate-owned high-rises (indicated in red) and are sized according
					to the total number of high-rises within each zip code.

					<p>
					The visual comparison between the earlier and later periods reveals a significant
					increase in corporate ownership across several key areas of the city. Not only does
					this indicate a concentration of corporate interest in certain neighborhoods, but it
					also suggests a potential shift in the demographic and socio-economic fabric of
					these areas. The larger pie charts in specific zip codes point to a surge in high-rise
					development, hinting at a changing skyline driven by corporate investment strategies.

				<figcaption>
					Understanding the financial implications of increased corporate ownership of high-rises,
					we examine the change in real median prices within the zip codes. By focusing on areas
					with data available from both the initial and latter five-year periods, we can assess
					whether the presence of corporate-owned high-rises correlates with changes in property
					values. The bar chart above shows the percent change in the median real price of
					high-rises across different zip codes, indicating substantial price increases in
					areas with a higher prevalence of corporate ownership. This suggests that corporate
					investment in high-rises may be a contributing factor to rising property values, thus
					potentially affecting affordability for average Bostonians.

					Now let’s shift our focus to the second question. As Boston's market
					evolves, it is important to understand who is buying property. My analysis
					categorizes transactions as either investor or non-investor purchases across
					various property types over time. My goal is to reveal patterns in investment
					activity and to offer insights into market dynamics and housing availability.

					<p>
					The stacked bar chart illustrates the percentage of real estate transactions
					attributed to non-investors versus investors of various sizes. A distinct
					trend emerges: the share of properties purchased by non-investors has been
					decreasing over time across all property types. The increasing investor
					interest in multi-unit residences may also suggest a shift toward rental
					markets or property development projects.

				Next, I want to zoom in on the geographic distribution of investor transactions
				to examine the changing landscape. The maps juxtapose the investor activity for
				the periods 2003-2007 and 2018-2022, with the dots being sized by median real
				price. This offers a visual representation of where investors are directing
				their capital and reveals the changes in property valuations across Boston.
				The maps suggest that strategic investments have likely influenced the increase
				in real estate prices in specific neighborhoods. The higher median prices,
				showed by the growing size of the circles, reflect a compound effect of investor
				activities in evolving urban areas.

				<figcaption>
					Building on the understanding of investor influence, I want to now
					turn my attention to the luxury segment of the market (the threshold of
					$1 million for a luxury listing is an academically recognized benchmark
					in major U.S. urban markets, as suggested by studies published in the
					Journal of Real Estate Finance and Economics). Luxury listings not only
					reflect on the city's growth but also the shifts in high-end market
					demand. By exploring the change in the median prices of luxury listings,
					we can identify the trends in investor engagement. The rising yellow bar
					(i.e. the percent share of luxury transactions) reveals that luxury
					transactions are taking up an increasing share of the market over the
					years, with the median real price of these luxury properties also climbing.
					As the upscale market expands, I am curious about the broader
					implications on housing diversity and affordability.

				<figcaption>
					Building upon the previous chart, I would now like to focus on the median
					real prices of luxury properties segmented by type. The chart differentiates
					between single-family residences, multi-family residences, and condominiums.
					This will allow me to understand which categories are most sought after by
					upscale buyers. The median real price trajectories for 1-family and 2-family
					residences exhibit volatility over time. This may indicate changing economic
					conditions or consumer preferences. The 3-family residences show a generally
					upward trend, but with less volatility compared to 1-family and 2-family
					homes. This would imply that these properties are less sensitive to market
					fluctuations due to, for instance, a smaller market size. Lastly,
					condominiums display a different trend, with their median real prices
					increasing more consistently over time. This growth could be reflective
					of the increasing desirability of condominiums in urban settings. These
					differences among property types highlight  the varied preferences of
					luxury homebuyers.
