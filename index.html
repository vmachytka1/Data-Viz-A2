					In recent years, Boston has seen an increase in the development of high-rise
					buildings.A notable trend I want to focus my analysis on is whether there is a 
					growing percentage of these properties that are owned by corporations. Corporate 
					ownership in residential areas can impact local communities, property availability, 
					and housing prices. The upward slope of the red line in the graph highlights a 
					trend: an increasing proportion of high-rises are falling under corporate 
					ownership. This would signal to me that corporations view high rises as 
					profitable assets.

					To understand the trend of corporate ownership more, it is essential to investigate
					where these high-rises are located within Boston. By mapping the distribution and
					comparing the first and last five years in the dataset, we gain insight into the
					'hot spots' of development and corporate investment. The pie charts represent the
					proportion of corporate-owned high-rises (indicated in red) and are sized according
					to the total number of high-rises within each zip code.

					<p>
					The visual comparison between the earlier and later periods reveals a significant
					increase in corporate ownership across several key areas of the city. Not only does
					this indicate a concentration of corporate interest in certain neighborhoods, but it
					also suggests a potential shift in the demographic and socio-economic fabric of
					these areas. The larger pie charts in specific zip codes point to a surge in high-rise
					development, hinting at a changing skyline driven by corporate investment strategies.
